    "## The Origins of Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to analyzing the origins of modern Reinforcement Learning, there are three separate starting points that eventually merge to form what we know today: Optimal Control, Trial and Error through Animal Learning, and, less prevalent, Temporal-Difference Methods. First we will be starting with optimal control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Around the mid-1950s, Richard Bellman and others tackled the problem of \"optimal control\", described as minimizing a metric of a constantly changing enviroment over time. By combining the system's own state and a value function, optimized for a certain return goal, they were able to create a functional equation, one that is now known as the Bellman equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This marks the beginning of what we now know as dynamic programming, the process of solving complex problems by breaking them down into subproblems and building upon each smaller solved one. Bellman also is credited with creating the Markovian decision process (MDPs) while Ronald Howard added on to MDPs by making the policy iteration method for them.\n",
    " \n",
    "The next major part is trial and error through animal learning, a practice, that according to American spychologist R. S. Woodworth, goes as far back as the late 1850s. One of the first few to truly recognize the concept of trial-and-error was Edward Thorndike, an American psychologist that worked extensively on comparitive psychology and the learning process. He initially stated what is now know as \"The Law of Effect\", a law that describes the correlation between reinforcing events and choosing actions. Over time, the theory was adapted to and laid the foundations for many professionals in the field, such as Pavlov and B. F. Skinner. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1948, Alan Turing described a \"pleasure-pain system,\" which was expanded on and became the basis for the work of animal psychology and reinforcement learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to a lot of confusion in the previous decades due to people using the words reinforcement learning and other types of learning (such as perceptual and supervised) as synonyms, there was a period of silence where development in the field proved slow. Although, there were some exceptions to this trend. The terms \"reinforcement\" and \"reinforcement learning\" were actually used in scientific literature for the first time. This is also the time period where Minksky's paper \"Steps Toward Artificial Intelligence\" that talked about the problem of \"How  do  you  distribute  credit  for  success  among  the  many  decisions  that  may  have  been involved in producing it?\". Many topics in this paper are still relevant today. Some other examples are the system STeLLA by John Andreae and MENACE by Donald Michie.\n",
    "\n",
    "One person in particular who is attributed to reviving the field is Harry Klopf, who recognized that there were characteristics of \"adaptive behavior\" that were being fully ignored. The idea he proposed was the drive to reach a goal in the enviroment, to have a clear desired outcome and undesired end. Eventually, this push evolved into the official distinction between supervised and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, this is the third and last part regarding the origins of reinforcement learning: temporal-difference learning. The origins of this concept can be attributed to animal learning psychology, specifically in the idea of secondary reinforcers. A second reinforcer is a stimulus that has been passively associated with with a primary reinforer and thus has a similar effect. \n",

    "## States and Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/states_actions.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first core concept we will cover is the understanding of what states and actions are. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that is agent-oriented; it relies on its enviroment rather than a teacher to achieve its desired goal. This is similar to how humans learn, through the steps of trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take for example a person learning to navigate a maze. A state can compropise of any crossroad they are met with, an action is defined as a choice/direction they choose to go, and the goal (reward) is defined as them reaching the end of the maze.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the person navigates the maze, they will naturally discover that some paths are less optimal than others, while some do not ever reach the end. Ideally, over time, they would be able to navigate the most optimal path every time. And this is what we are trying to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markov Decision Process \n",
    "\n",
    "Building on top of states and actions is the next step, a Markov Decision Process (MDP). A MDP can be simplified to a tuple containing 5 parts:\n",
    "   \n",
    "S - set of states   \n",
    "A - set of actions   \n",
    "P - probability that an action *a* at state *s* at time *t* will get to state *s + 1* at time *t + 1*   \n",
    "R - reward received after moving from state *s* to state *s + 1*   \n",
    "$\\gamma$ - discount factor that can optimize future rewards vs present rewards\n",
    "   \n",
    "Each of these play a role in determining a final \"policy\" $\\pi$; a rule that says given a state *s*, action *a* will be taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/markov.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the standard relationship between an Agent and the Enviroment in a MDP. An agent is the one who learns and makes decision while the enviroment is everything outside of the agent. These two variables constantly interact and feed each other data, with the enviroment supplying the agent with rewards and the agent triggering the effects of the enviroment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Not sure if I want to include this or not, talks about why the distribution of S and R is only dependent on the prior state and action values).*\n",
    "$$p({s',r | s,a}) \\doteq P\\{S_t = s', R_t = r | S_{s-1} = s , A_{t-1} = a\\}$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "What this equation states, is that in a *finite* MDP, there are a limited number of states, actions, and rewards. Because of this, we can discern that the random variables R and S have a probability distribution based only \n",

    "   \n",
    "$\\alpha$ - the learning rate, typically a small value between 0 and 1, indicates how much we update over values every time we take an action. Typically this value tends to be smaller in order not to overrepresent certain action. However it can also be 1, so that the $Q(s_t, a_t)$ terms cancel out (this is done in DQN).\n",
    "    \n",
    "$\\gamma$ - discount factor, encourages an agent to seek a reward sooner than later, typically set between .9 and .99. This makes agents receive a smaller reward in the present to give better incentive for future rewards. The effect of the discount factor can be seen when the Bellman equation is expanded, and $\\alpha = 1$.\n",

    "# DQN (Deep Q Network)\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2013, researchers at DeepMind presented one of the first models combining reinforcement learning with a convolutional neural network. Using a neural network, they approximated the Q function, with the state being pixels from the Atari 2600. This model was able to outperform all previous approaches on playing six of the games, and outperforms human experts on three of the games.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Network Training\n",
    "Frames are cropped to 84x84 regions that capture the game playing area and converted to grayscale, then 4 frames are stacked to capture movement at each step. The resulting stack of frames is used as the state at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network is then trained with RMSprop on the mean squared error of $Q(s)$ computed from the network and the actual reward received.  10,000,000 frames were used to train for each game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experience Replay\n",
    "Each state, action, reward and new state (known as transitions) are saved in a \"replay memory\", and at each step, a random sample of transitions are taken to train the network with. This is known as experience replay, and has a few benefits, including greater data efficiency (each state transition is used more than once) and more efficient learning (randomly sampled states are less correlated than sequential states). This also avoids oscillation and divergence, because the current state is not entirely dependent on the model's parameters at that time. The replay memory can holds the last 1,000,000 frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target Network\n",
    "The authors of DQN followed up with another technique in which 2 separate Q networks are used, one to train, and one to calculate the target value during training. Every 10,000 steps, the parameters from the trained network are copied over to the target network. This also avoids oscillation and divergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's perform a similar setup with a toy problem (the Frozen Lake)"
